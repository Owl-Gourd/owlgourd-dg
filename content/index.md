title: Owl Gourd's Digital Garden
---

Greetings, hi, hello. 

I'm Owl Gourd and this is (will be) my [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought), where I aim to grow music, writing, code, and whateveryouwannacallit in public. I will share works-in-progress and engage in an iterative process of creation out in the open. This is an experiment in inverting my tendency to only share what's perfect. 

If you've stumbled into this garden and spend any meaningful time here, please [drop me a note](mailto:owlgourd@proton.me). I'd love to hear from you.
